# floor division operator (//) == its simply like division but it returns us the integer one and down it. like if we divide , 5/2 = 2.5 .. but the floor division makes it like this ,  5//2 = 2


# exponent operator (**) its like the power


# mod operator(#) its the modulus operator


a , b , c = 2,8,5

product_a_b = a*b
print(product_a_b)


print(product_a_b // c)
print(a ** b)
print(b%c)
